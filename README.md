# Digitizing Medieval Manuscripts in the Midwest

The Peripheral Manuscripts Project maintains a public-facing website over at <https://peripheralmss.org/>.
Navigate to that site for a description of our project, contact information, project news, and other information.

This GitHub repository hosts some project files for which we want to maintain a clear record of file history.
For now, this is mostly limited to our project documentation, which is based on the metadata practices of the [Bibliotheca Philadelphiensis Project](http://bibliophilly.pacscl.org/).
There are three principal files (in development): 

- [Project Style Guide](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/documentation/style-guide.md). General guidelines for style, usage, and terminology
- [Metadata Guide](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/documentation/metadata-guide.md). Line-item instructions for entry of administrative information and collection- and item-level metadata.
- [Page-Level Metadata Guide](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/documentation/structural-metadata-guide.md). Line-item instructions for entry of metadata keyed to individual image files

This repository also contains our [CLIR grant application](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/archive/CLIRHC_PeripheralMss_Round2Application-without-uploads.pdf) 
and
[Community Agreement and Code of Conduct](https://github.com/midwest-manuscripts/peripheralmss/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
