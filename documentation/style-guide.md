# BIBLIOTHECA PHILADELPHIENSIS DIGITIZATION PROJECT

## CATALOGUING GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS

The purpose of the following guidelines is to insure **consistency** in
the entry of cataloguing data and descriptions, including data type,
format, and terminology. Consistency here means regularity,
predictability, uniformity, and "searchability." Whether a manuscript
specialist or an interested non-specialist, the user of the *Bibliotheca
Philadelphiensis* digitized catalogue should expect to find the same
amount and type of data in each entry field, and in the same general
order.

**Consistency** in all fields is particularly important for manuscripts
of the same title: Bible, Gospels, Missal, Lectionary, Book of Hours,
etc.

*Please refer to the [BiblioPhilly Spreadsheet Metadata
Guidelines](http://drive.google.com/open?id=1V--1-XZI7pv9DJ9Kc8NK-O4sOOISWo0hz__rqGEw_jU)
for details on what information should be included in specific fields if
that information is not provided in this document.*

## GENERAL GUIDELINES: [Format]{.underline}

The **Description** field is the only entry field to be composed in full
sentences (subject, verb, object) and with verbs in the present tense.
All other fields should be in phrases or fragments, except where the
meaning becomes confusing and difficult to express without a subject,
verb and object.

### [Capitalization, Spacing, Punctuation]{.underline}

Capitalize the beginning of all entries in all fields. Avoid using
unnecessary abbreviations in entries; do not abbreviate the word
"Saint". Single space (not double) between sentences.

Punctuation follows American usage and goes inside quotation marks:
"\... Gothic." Period at end of full sentences only, not phrases or
fragments (as here)

Avoid unnecessary use of colons in entries.

Semi-colon to separate elements of a fragment

Serial (Oxford) comma: red, white, and blue

If one element in a series of three or more itself consists of a series
of three or more, use a semi-colon, rather than a comma, between
elements of a greater series: 13 stripes; 52 stars; and a color scheme
of red, white, and blue

### [Titles]{.underline}

Use lower case for all but first word in a title: A tainted mantle
(*not* A Tainted Mantle)

**NB**: An exception to this rule is that book types, e.g. Psalter,
Lectionary, Book of Hours, Book of
Hours Use of Rome, Missal etc. should always be capitalized in titles.
This also applies to terms like Chronicle if it is used in the sense of
it being that type of book, and not just a word in the title, e.g.
Grandes Chroniques

If a slash or colon is part of a title, leave a space on either side: A
tainted mantle : Hercules and the classical tradition at the Carolingian
court

### [Numbers and Dates]{.underline}

Numbers should be spelled out from one to one hundred in running text
(like the description and longer descriptive passages). After one
hundred, use numerals. Also spell out round numbers: two thousand, but
2,341. Exceptions include numbers in chapters, volumes, verses: chapter
6, volume 2, verse 7

Avoid beginning an entry with a number, but if a number is necessary,
spell it out: Thirty-seven full-page illuminations and 103 historiated
initials

Spell out ordinal numbers: first, not 1^st^ ; this also applies to
centuries within text fields: the fourteenth century; a
fourteenth-century manuscript

HOWEVER, in the date narrative field **only**, use the following format
for a century date: 9^th^ century

Hyphenate a century only if it is an adjective: a tenth-century
palimpsest (Otherwise: a palimpsest from the tenth century)

Use a hyphen, not a dash, to separate dates in a date range:
9^th^-11^th^ century CE

For a birth or death date (e.g., of an author, scribe, patron etc.),
leave a space between the abbreviation and the year: d. 968

For an approximate date, do not abbreviate circa: circa 1400. Circa date
should be only in the Date (narrative) field. Circa date (without
"circa") should also be in the Date (single) field.

### [Citations and Abbreviations]{.underline}

Biblical citations: Exodus 10:12-15 (names of chapters should not be
abbreviated, so spell out
"Genesis," not "Gen.")

Preferred abbreviation for folio: fol. (plural: fols.)

**NB**: There is a space between a folio abbreviation and a folio
number: fol. 5r

Preferred abbreviation for manuscript/manuscripts: Ms./Mss.

## MAIN CATALOG ENTRY FIELDS
in order of appearance
**(See also BiblioPhilly Spreadsheet Metadata Guidelines for field
definitions)**:

### Repository Country:
Always "United States"

### Repository City:
Name of the city *only*, do not include the name of
the state

### Holding Institution:
Name of the institution above the
**Repository**. The **Repository** will be the name of the library, so
the **Holding Institution** will usually be the name of a university.
Full name, do not use abbreviations.

### Repository Name:
Full name, do not use abbreviations.

### Call Number/ID:
Will vary from institution to institution. Use what
is provided by the institution.

### Manuscript Name:
Use names provided by institution. When supplying a
name, do so in English.

### Authors:
Preference is to put the **Authority name:** Common name --
this links up with **Author URI**, usually VIAF number, with the idea
that here you will use the standardized version of the name as
designated by the LoC on their website:
[http://authorities.loc.gov/](http://authorities.loc.gov/)

If there is not an Authority Name, **Name as written or supplied in
Latin alphabet:** Give the name of the author in Latin letters in
authority form (Last Name, First Name)

### Translators, Artists, Former Owners:
Same rules as **Author** fields
above

### Provenance:
In this field the whole known history of the manuscript
should be given. Provenance is concerned with the individuals or
institutions that may have owned or handled a book up to and including
the present time, and should be written out chronologically. Record
**Former Owner Names** separately, in authorized form.

### Date (narrative):
Enter the phrase as given in this row and supply
start and end dates in the appropriate rows, as in the following
examples:

  **Date (narrative)**              **Supply Date (range) start**   **Supply Date (range) end**
  --------------------------------- ------------------------------- -----------------------------
  14th century                      1300                            1399
  Early 14th century                1300                            1315
  First quarter 14th century        1300                            1325
  Fourth quarter 14th century       1375                            1399
  Mid-14th century                  1340                            1360
  14th century after 1320           1320                            1399
  Late 14th century                 1385                            1399
  Late 14th or early 15th century   1385                            1415
  Mid-14th to early 15th century    1340                            1415
  14th or 15th century              1300                            1499

### Place of Origin:
This should be a modern geographical location
whenever possible (Flanders being a rare exception). The smallest
component of the location should be listed first, followed by larger
locations, usually simply City, Country, e.g. "Oxford, England," but
this could be more specific, such as "Monastery of Reichenau, Lake
Constance, Germany," or could include a region either after a city or as
a more specific element before a country. If country is not known, then
a region with an accepted or commonly used geographical designation may
be given. Cardinal specifications (for example, Northern France) may be
included. Conjectural locations may be followed by a question mark, but
only one question mark should be used in an origin series, at the most
specific level:

-   Paris, France
-   Oxford?, England
-   Florence?, Tuscany, Italy
-   Tuscany?, Italy
-   Northwestern France

The final element of an origin preferably will be an entry from the
European geographic keywords:

-   Austria
-   England
-   Flanders
-   France
-   Germany
-   Greece
-   Italy
-   Netherlands
-   Romania
-   Russia
-   Spain

Multiple locations may be entered in multiple columns for codices
containing multiple manuscripts with different origins bound together.

If a manuscript's location of origin cannot be determined within Europe
(as is the case for some Greek manuscripts, for example), enter
Undetermined.

### Description:
Each **Description** should, in a **maximum of 250
words,** introduce or summarize the salient features of a book's
textual, material and artistic contents, emphasizing the most important
qualities that the reader will need to know about the manuscript -- what
makes it special or important? Qualitative judgments and subjective
adjectives should be used sparingly. Important information to include,
when known, are the date of the manuscript, its origin, if it is
illuminated, if it is complete or fragmentary, and the names of authors,
scribes, and artists where applicable.

### Language:
Name of the language or languages represented in the
manuscript. Include names only, one name per column. If there are notes
about the use of languages (e.g., "Latin with Greek glosses") include
all the language names in the **Language** field, and add the additional
information as a **Note**. Use the following Language codes (from the
ISO 639-2) - full names are provided for reference, do not include them
in the field:

-   lat \[Latin\]
-   grc \[Greek\]
-   xno \[Anglo-Norman\]
-   arm \[Armenian\]
-   chu \[Church Slavonic\]
-   dum \[Dutch\]
-   eng \[English after approx 1500\]
-   enm \[English, Middle, to approx 1500\]
-   frm \[French, Middle, approx. 1400-1600\]
-   fro \[French, Old, before approx. 1400\]
-   ger \[German, after approx. 1500\]
-   gmh \[German, Middle High, approx. 1050-1500\]
-   goh \[German, Old High, approx. 750-1050\]
-   heb \[Hebrew\]
-   nds \[Low German\]
-   ita \[Italian\]
-   cat \[Catalan\]
-   spa \[Spanish\]

### Foliation/Pagination:
How the leaves or pages of the manuscript are
numbered (in foliation, each leaf is numbered once; in pagination, both
the recto and verso side of each leaf are numbered), and where the
numbers appear on the leaves, such as *upper right recto* or *lower
outer corners*, or *Modern foliation in pencil, upper right recto*

### Flyleaves & Leaves:
Formula showing the numbers of flyleaves and
leaves, in the format \[front flyleaves\]+\[leaves\]+\[back flyleaves\],
for example ii+113+iii. No spaces. Make note of the flyleaf material
using the **Note** field.

### Layout:
The easiest layout details to capture are number of columns
and number of lines per page, if those are generally consistent
throughout the manuscript or in sections of the manuscript. Information
about how a page is ruled and by what means (drypoint, lead, ink) also
goes here.

A written area that is delineated by four intersecting lines that run
from edge to edge is **frame-ruled**

A written area that is delineated by a floating box is **box-ruled**

### Colophon:
Transcription of the colophon, if present. Any other
information about a colophon should be a **Note**.

### Collation:
There are three options for values for the collation
field, depending on whether you give a diagram to Dot, make a model in
the Collation Modeler, or generate a formula. Before ingestion, all
manuscripts will have a collation formula. Collation Modeler is here:
[https://biblio-philly-collations.herokuapp.com/](https://biblio-philly-collations.herokuapp.com/)

Proofreaders: If there is anything other than "Structure Uncertain" or a
collation formula/description in this field, please contact Dot.

-   **Draw a diagram and give it to Dot**: diagram submitted
-   **Make a model in the Collation Modeler**: model created
-   **Collation formula generation from model**: \[paste formula here\]
-   **Collation can't be determined**: Structure Uncertain

If you can determine part of the collation, but not the entire
thing, you can also describe the collation as best you can and
this will be passed to the TEI

### Script:
Information about the type of lettering used in the
manuscript, preferring the terms listed below if applicable.

- Square Capitals
- Rustic Capitals
- Uncial
- Half-Uncial
- Caroline Minuscule
- Protogothic
- Gothic\--textualis quadrata (consistent application of feet and biting of curves)
- Gothic\--textualis semi-quadrata (inconsistent application of feet and biting of curves)
- Gothic\--textualis (everything below semi-quadrata; 
for Gothic with single-compartment *a*, sometimes called semitextualis, add a note: 
"Gothic\--textualis; single-compartment *a*")
- Gothic\--rotunda (round Italian textualis, not Brownian rotunda, which is English with rounded-off minims)
- Gothic\--anglicana
- Gothic\--cursiva
- Littera bononiensis
- Secretary
- Bâtarde
- Mercantesca
- Hybrida
- Humanistic
- Humanistic Cursive
- Humanistic semi-cursive
- Greek Minuscule

**Hebrew Scripts**

- Ashkenazi square hand
- Sephardi square hand
- Sephardi semi-cursive hand
- Square script
- Semi-cursive script

If the scribe is identifiable, include the scribe's name, preceded by
"Scribe:" For example, "Scribe: Thomas Hoccleve".

### Catchwords:
If catchwords are present, where are they found, and
what is the orientation on the page (at the bottom, along the side
margin, etc.), e.g.: On versos, bottom right corner. If they are not
consistent (for instance, where the pages are cropped and some are
missing), indicate that as well.

### Signatures:
If they are using a system in which quires are marked
progressively, rather than using catchwords, you can explain that here.
Same rules apply as for catchwords.

### Note(s):
Additional information about the manuscript that does not
fit into other fields can be added as a note. Acknowledgements of e.g.
cataloging work should not be included in Notes. Unrelated notes should
be separated out into individual cells.

### Related resource:
For Bibliographic citations, use the **modified
Chicago Style for notes** (with Last Name, First Name for first author;
hyphens instead of en-dashes for page ranges; p. and pp. for page
numbers), as in the following examples:

\[note that the page or page range where a manuscript is mentioned is
given first, then the full range of the article or chapter is given
within brackets. Hyphens (not en dashes) should be used to indicate page
ranges.\]

## Page-level

### TOC:
In Latin transcribed and/or supplied title in square brackets.

### INC and EXP:
Include only for works where they are especially
helpful or meaningful. Do not provide these for Books of Hours, Bibles,
or other standard texts.

On the spreadsheet, INC and EXP for a text belong in the same row as the
TOC for the text. The folio number of the location of the incipit and
explicit go inside the field, after the text, in square brackets, and
following the formatting for folio numbering described earlier in this
document:

  **DISPLAY PAGE**   **FILE\_NAME**   **TAG1**   **VALUE1**   **TAG2**   **VALUE2**                 **TAG3**   **VALUE3**
  ------------------ ---------------- ---------- ------------ ---------- -------------------------- ---------- -------------------------
  5v                 1234-9473.tif    TOC1       Title        INC        Here begins. \[fol. 5v\]   EXP        Here ends. \[fol. 31r\]

In those instances when there is more than one TOC on the same page, the
INC and EXP come after the corresponding TOC. It is fine if some TOCs
lack INC or EXP:

> TOC1 INC TOC2 INC EXP TOC3 EXP \[etc.\]

### DECO:
Brief description of the decoration or illustration. If there
is a type of decoration include the type, followed by a comma, followed
by a description: Diagram, furnace. Anything that can be described well
in the manuscript-level **Decoration** field does not belong in the
page-level **DECO** field, e.g., "Alternating red and blue initials
throughout."

### Special instructions for Books of Hours

Examples of section descriptions (for descriptions and page-level
metadata):

**[TOC elements:]{.underline}**

- Calendar
- Calendar, in French
  - i.e. only include the language if it is not Latin
  - in general any vernacular prayers or rubrics should be pointed out
- Gospel Lessons
- Passion according to John
- Hours of the Virgin, Use of Rome
- Hours of the Virgin, Use of Rome, intercalated with the Hours of the Cross and Hours of the Holy Spirit
  - We have decided **not** to list the individual hours within the office. Even if they begin with miniatures
- Penitential Psalms, Litany, and Prayers
- Prayer, Obsecro te
- Prayer, O intemerata
- Prayer, Salva sancta facies
- Prayers, beginning with Salva sancta facies
- Office of the Dead
- Suffrages
  - individual suffrages **not** listed as TOC element

**[DECO elements:]{.underline}**

- Inhabited initial Q, a monk
  - inhabited = figures that are decorative only, with no precise subject, i.e. a saint
- Historiated initial D, Annunciation
  - historiated = identifiable figure, i.e. Saint Peter, or a scene, i.e. Martyrdom of Saint Paul
- Small miniature, Annunciation
- Large miniature, Annunciation
- Full-page miniature, Annunciation
  - the distinction is that a full-page miniature has no lines of text on the page

Sometimes miniatures are divided into subsections, for example a
full-page miniature that depicts four different stages of a character's
story within the same frame. In this case identify the size of the
miniature, then each section individually separated by semicolons. Each
group of sections (e.g., top row, bottom row) should be preceded by a
directional cue describing which direction the images are to be read.
The following example is from a Hebrew manuscript, so images are to be
read upper to lower, right to left:

-   Full-page miniature, upper right to left, Moses with Jethro's flock
    (Exodus 3:1); Moses and the Burning Bush (Exodus 3:5); lower right
    to left, Moses answers the Lord, holding up his rod -- a
    shepherd's staff (Exodus 4:2); his rod turns into a serpent
    (Exodus 4:4); Moses holds the serpent (Exodus 4:4)

Names of standard iconographies:

- Annunciation
- Visitation
- Nativity
- Annunciation to the Shepherds
- Adoration of the Magi
- Presentation in the Temple
- Flight into Egypt
- Massacre of the Innocents
- Coronation of the Virgin
- Agony in the Garden
- Crucifixion
- Pentecost
- Saint John the Baptist
- Saint Catherine
  - we have decided to include Saint before proper names of saints

## Keyword Assignments

Beginning in September 2017, keywords will be assigned by proofreaders
(for manuscripts that have already been cataloged) and by catalogers
(for manuscripts being cataloged, both at Penn and elsewhere)

The keyword assignment process involves adding a keywords row to the
spreadsheet, and then assigning the keywords.

1.  Add a Subject: keywords row to the spreadsheet. Add the heading with
    one blank row between it and the **Subject: genre/form URI** row: 
    [SCREEN SHOT OMITTED]

2.  Keywords are listed in the [BiblioPhilly Keywords google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U6Xk39Pr3UYvbpUjN2SC6rJjJ26Y5F-QMVX\_Dq0SENM/edit\#gid=1871258630)

3.  Keywords are in seven groups: Book Type, Century, Culture,
    Descriptive term, Geography, Subject, and Other.

4.  Add one keyword per column. You should be able to add at least one
    from Book Type, Century, Culture, and Geography. Add Descriptive
    Terms, Subjects, and Others as relevant.

5.  Keywords are to help users find the books. So consider what terms a
    user might select to try to find this book or a book like it, in
    addition to considering which terms apply to this book.

6.  Copy and paste terms to avoid misspellings.

7.  **If you want to add a new term** email the group (Dot, Erin, Amey,
    Nick, Diane, Andrew, and Jen Grayburn) to explain the need and
    we'll deliberate. Terms will need to be added to the Google doc
    and then further added to the XML that is ingested into the TEI
    records.
